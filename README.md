Mail Classifier 
====================

This project aims to implement or study machine learning models and to use them to classify emails into 2 classes:  
Spam and Ham (Non-Spam)
  
**Dataset Used**: Enron Spam/Ham Mail data  
**Models Used**: Logistic Regression, Artificial Neural Network, Support Vector Machine

Logistic Regression, ANN have been implemented (both with regularization). **LIBSVM** and **LIBLINEAR** packages were used to study SVM nature with custom Gaussian Kernel (for non-linear SVM).

**alpha** = Learning rate  
**lambda** = Regularization Parameter  
**C** = Regularization Parameter for SVM  
**sigma** = Gaussian function parameter

All the Spam mails are inserted into mails/spam directory.  
All the Ham mails are inserted into mails/ham directory

**extract.py** contains modules to:

 - tokenize the text passed
 - uses various regex to filter and replace certain pattern
 - uses porter stemmer
 - extract top [400 to 500] list of most occurring words in all the
   mails in the data set, which will be used as a feature list for the
   training and testing data.

**create_data.py** uses extract.py to convert raw emails into proper format for learning models.  
**demo.py** runs and tests all these 3 models against the data generated by create_data.py

    [This SVM module of sklearn package does not provides the feature weights in case of non-linear SVM]

Observation 
-----------

 - From the predictor list of all these models we can see that the words
   like:  	**money, offer, no, million, qualiti, life, secur** are common
   top predictors, 	which, according to human intellectual deduction,
   also somewhat refers to Spam nature of mail to some extent.

 - SVM with Gaussian kernel performed best among all the models, in
   reference to both training and validation accuracies.
